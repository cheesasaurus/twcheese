# Tribal Wars scripts

I started creating Tribal Wars scripts in 2008. Even back then, there was talk amongst scripters about making some kind of modular system for code sharing. This project is my manifestation of that idea. I've made dozens of scripts over the years, and brought the most popular ones into this repo for anyone to contribute.

I don't play any more. I'm not going to spend time building up an account and debugging. But if you have a fix, I still pay attention to pull requests and emails.

And yes, you should prefer `const` over `let` when writing new code. This codebase doesn't adhere to that - but only because this was my first foray into moving past es5. ðŸ¤·
